# Description
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

# Installation
In order to run the application you need to access the terminal  and run the local host using 'npm run dev'. From there you can access the database from a program like insomnia and test all of the routes using GET, POST, PUT, and DELTE requests.

# Usage
This is a backend specific application for an up-and-coming social media platform. Through GET, POST, PUT, and DELTE requests you can add/update users, add/delete friends, create new 'thoughts', and add reactions to thoughts.
